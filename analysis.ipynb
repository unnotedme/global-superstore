    "# Global Super Store Data Transformation and Analysis Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The global superstore is a fictitious company that specializes in selling office supplies, furniture, and technology products. It operates as an online marketplace and delivers products globally. It has also collected sales data from 2011 to 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this endeavour for the global superstore is to increase sales and, consequently, generate higher profits. This project’s central goal is to accomplish this objective. It intends to achieve this by creating a structured database design that includes a central table of facts and the required dimension tables to establish connections between different elements. This will enable meaningful comparisons and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To eliminate or reduce data redundancy as much as possible\n",
    "- To optimize data usage\n",
    "- To reduce data entry errors that may affect the data’s validity\n",
    "- Carry out analysis showing vital information between entities\n",
    "- Improve data consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entity Relations Diagram (ERD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERD was created based on the information given in the Excel file provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shekpaul/global-superstore).\n",

    "### Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales:** This is the fact table consisting of the price of the items, the costs, the shipping cost, and the quantity supplied.\n",
    "- **Products:** This involves the products’ names, categories, sub-categories, and descriptions.\n",
    "- **Location:** This contains the continents, countries, and cities to which the items are delivered.\n",
    "- **Time:** This contains the period of delivery — the exact day of the year, the year, the quarter of the year, and the month of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between entities\n",
    "\n",
    "A customer can make many orders and many orders may be made by one customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each shipping may have many orders made by customers and many orders can be conveyed through one shipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "One address can have many shippings and many shippings can have one address.\n",
    "\n",
    "A product can have many orders and many orders can have one product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sales can be made in one location and one location can have many sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sales can be made at a particular time\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sales can be made by selling one product and a product can have many sales.\n",

    "## Implement the data model\n",

    "The data model will be implemented using the MySQL Workbench Foward Engineering. "

    "# Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualization plays a pivotal role in modern data management by enhancing flexibility, resource utilization, and scalability. By abstracting physical infrastructure and creating virtual instances of servers, storage, and networks, virtualization enables efficient resource allocation and consolidation. This not only reduces hardware costs but also simplifies data center management. Additionally, virtualization facilitates the creation of isolated environments for testing and development, ensuring that changes and upgrades don't disrupt production systems. It also supports disaster recovery and backup solutions by enabling the rapid restoration of virtualized environments. Ultimately, virtualization empowers organizations to adapt swiftly to changing data requirements, optimize resource usage, and enhance overall data resilience and availability.\n",
